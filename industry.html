                <p>Throughout the group, we have a vast variety of Job titles, which is what individuals are called when they are in a specific department, or have a specific career at a job. Although the job titles vary, with two being Java Developers, we can understand the various amounts of skills that will be needed to obtain, or already possess, which can then be applied to this group project. </p>
                
                <h4 style="color:#355C7D">Question 2. From your group’s ideal jobs, you can identify a set of skills required for
                    these jobs?</h4>
                <h5 style="color:#355C7D">Question A:</h5>
                <p><strong>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from
                    employers? </strong><br>
                    In order, a couple of our IT-Specific skills are in relatively high demand, such as Java
                    developer, and Graphic Designer, however, .NET Developer, Analyst, and Systems Engineer, compare
                    lower to the other skills. With the lowest being Systems Engineer, this might be because once
                    there is a network infrastructure already implemented within a work environment, they no longer
                    require such a skill, also, System Engineers tend to be self employed, thus lowering the
                    statistical demand, due to the lower supply. However, the highest rank, Java Developer, becomes
                    much more demanding, as more businesses are trying to become more technologically savvy, by
                    creating a website, or an application, thus increasing the need of a java developer. Microsoft
                    Windows is one of the most common operating systems, thus, all individuals in our group would
                    have the required skill to operate the computer, and provide the required task that would needed
                    to be completed. When applying for a job that requires technical expertise, it is best to apply
                    accommodated with the required IT skills, this will increase the chances of being employed.

                </p>
                <h5 style="color:#355C7D">Question B:</h5>
                <p><strong>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from
                    employers? </strong><br>
                    General skills are what the individual has to become their ideal job, these skills are also in
                    demand from employers, so the individual can be an ideal candidate as an employee. The highest
                    demanding skill in the workforce is communication, this skill is the most vital skill to be able
                    to master for any environment, this is a trait that all group individuals have. Also, Problem
                    solving is the second most demanding, however, only half of the group have skills that fit this
                    demand. In order, third is organisational skills, which only ⅙ of the group obtains, as well as
                    Detail Oriented, then creativity, and then ⅓ have the skill of research, coming 10th in
                    most-demand. Lastly, being articulate comes third last in most demanding skill, however, this
                    also can be weaved into communication, as it relies on the ability to speak fluently, enough to
                    communicate successfully. General skills become vital within the workforce, as they can create a
                    more successful workplace, thus, having specific skills can become in high demand for jobs as
                    they allow more efficient work practices.
                </p>
                <h5 style="color:#355C7D">Question C:</h5>
                <p><strong>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill
                    set? </strong><br>
                    The three highest ranked IT-Specific skills that are not in the groups skill set, are SQL, SAP,
                    and Project Management. These skills were not mentioned as required skills for these jobs, as
                    the ideal jobs do not require such skills, or are not involved in such business departments. The
                    group’s ideal jobs are mostly to be employee titled, rather than employer, as their required
                    skills do not extend to those areas, for example, Project Management. SQL is a language that
                    skills such as JAVA, and Graphic designer do not apply to, however, if individuals who are
                    studying .NET, or becoming an Analyst for cloud base security, SQL might become beneficial for
                    their future careers, as it is not required, but rather a benefit to have . However, this does
                    not prevent the group individuals to carry out further studies to extend their knowledge in such
                    areas, and allowing them to have a higher chance at getting jobs that fit such description.

                </p>
                <h5 style="color:#355C7D">Question D:</h5>
                <p><strong>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill
                    set? </strong><br>
                    General skills are what individuals gain from experience, some may come equipped with more
                    skills than others, however, that does not stop that individual from still learning such
                    particular skills. A lot of general skills fit into one another, such as planning and time
                    management, detail oriented and quality assurance, however, unique but vital skills such as
                    writing, troubleshooting and leadership are unequipped within the groups skill sets. Writing is
                    a skill that can be learnt through education, however, this skill is something that strengthens
                    the more you practice. Practicing a specific skill allows the employee to analyse, and fix a
                    problem, such abilities can be vital for a business, as it enables the employee to create a
                    solution, without having to bring in more employees, or outsource, to come to a conclusion.
                    Leadership however, generally learnt at a young age, some people are born-leaders, yet, this
                    skill can be still be learnt through the process of experience, or practicing management.
                    General skills are what can always be obtained through everyday tasks, and they all gradually
                    develop and the individual becomes more skilled, therefore, regardless if the individuals do not
                    currently have a specific skill, they are bound to gain more knowledge towards that area, and
                    may even specialise.
                </p>
                <h4 style="color:#355C7D">Question 3:</h4>
                <p><strong>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why
                    or why not?</strong><br>
                    The data provided by burning glass, does not change the opinion of ideal jobs. As it gives us
                    insight into what skills are in high demand, and this allows the group to decide what more they
                    can do to benefit themselves for more knowledge-wealthy future. The studies can also enable us
                    to view pathways that can be taken to enhance, or possibly obtain jobs in the future, as
                    individuals who wished to get a specific job, now know the length they need to go to obtain that
                    dream, things such as learning SQL, or taking leadership courses, can give the group a much more
                    insightful future job.
