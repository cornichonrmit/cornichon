                    I'm a first year RMIT student studying the Bachelor of Information technology. I'm from Vietnam and
                    this is my third year living in Melbourne. I really like the environment and living experience here
                    as well as it's people. I speak several languages including English, Vietnamese,... and that's
                    pretty much it. Just enjoy you thinking I'm a genius for a second there :). </p>

                    <strong>Personal Information: </strong><br>
                    I was born in Melbourne, Australia and have not lived anywhere else but have travelled frequently
                    with family. I was enrolled in Melbourne Grammar School from the day i started schooling and
                    graduated year 12 in 2018. My interest in IT started at a young age with the family computer, i
                    would always be playing games, then once i got my own personal laptop i got more interested in the
                    technical side and was introduced to a robotics subject that was available at school. After a year
                    of robotics our school, a inter-school competition was held, and after that my interest in IT
                    related concepts has only grown, moving from robotics to programming and game hacking.

                    Hi, my name is Tom. I am Australian. I am a mature aged student studying a Bachelor of IT at RMIT
                    University. After I completed year 12, I undertook an Electrical Apprenticeship and worked in
                    various roles in smelting and mine processing operations for the past 12 years. These roles include
                    electrician, Maintenance & Operations Supervisor and Process Control Technician/Engineer. An
                    interesting fact about myself is that I love travelling. I spent 3 months backpacking around Europe
                    in 2014, multiple trips to New Zealand, South East Asia and North America. I am heading to Fiji for
                    a short break over Easter.

            <p>The purpose of this segment is to look at the individual group members test results, such as the myers
                briggs test or other emotion / working ability tests. From comparing results we can compare group
                members and see who will be most effective in certain parts of the project. We can also use this
                comparison to make the group working experience as fluid as possible.</p>
