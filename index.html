                    I'm a first year RMIT student studying the Bachelor of Information technology. I'm from Vietnam and
                    this is my third year living in Melbourne. I really like the environment and living experience here
                    as well as it's people. I speak several languages including English, Vietnamese,... and that's
                    pretty much it. Just enjoy you thinking I'm a genius for a second there :). </p>

                    <strong>Personal Information: </strong><br>
                    I was born in Melbourne, Australia and have not lived anywhere else but have travelled frequently
                    with family. I was enrolled in Melbourne Grammar School from the day i started schooling and
                    graduated year 12 in 2018. My interest in IT started at a young age with the family computer, i
                    would always be playing games, then once i got my own personal laptop i got more interested in the
                    technical side and was introduced to a robotics subject that was available at school. After a year
                    of robotics our school, a inter-school competition was held, and after that my interest in IT
                    related concepts has only grown, moving from robotics to programming and game hacking.

                    Hi, my name is Tom. I am Australian. I am a mature aged student studying a Bachelor of IT at RMIT
                    University. After I completed year 12, I undertook an Electrical Apprenticeship and worked in
                    various roles in smelting and mine processing operations for the past 12 years. These roles include
                    electrician, Maintenance & Operations Supervisor and Process Control Technician/Engineer. An
                    interesting fact about myself is that I love travelling. I spent 3 months backpacking around Europe
                    in 2014, multiple trips to New Zealand, South East Asia and North America. I am heading to Fiji for
                    a short break over Easter.

                <h3><strong>Team Profile Summary</strong></h3>
                <p>Based on the results of the tests we did in assignment 1, although our group has a great distribution
                    among the types of personalities, we found that there are certain similarities that we can take
                    advantage of when it comes to working as a team. For example, 5 in 6 members of our group tend to
                    work
                    based on Judging and Planning rather than Prospecting. This information will help us deciding how we
                    operate our team and allocate workload to reach its highest potential. Another interesting fact is
                    that
                    our team doesn't have any auditory learner, which means that we can eliminate auditory information
                    where
                    possible and focus on hands-on work and visual explanation when working together. It is fair to say
                    that
                    these information will prove helpful later when we work on projects, however, it is considered a
                    guideline and estimation rather than a fact that we need to follow. Improvisation and feedbacks are
                    needed as we make changes to thrive as a group in later stages.</p>

                <h3><strong>Ideal Jobs Summary</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    Overall, our team members have different interests in a variety of fields, each cover a different
                    part
                    of IT which makes us a team that can operate independently with minor conflicts. As a result, we are
                    suitable for almost any kind of job that requires a broad range of IT skills and coverage of
                    different
                    aspects.
                    <br><br>
                    In our group, Thomas and Franklin are interested in a similar type of work which is Senior Java
                    Developer who takes care of technical skills involving hard coding and software developing. On top
                    of
                    that, they also have the ability to plan and guide the team through different operations of the
                    project.
                    What differentiate these two from the rest of the group is that they focus on Java applications
                    including developing, improving and maintaining them. Mike's ideal job is somewhat similar to these
                    two
                    in terms of working environment, he will be working with .NET platforms and dealing with different
                    types
                    of programming language.
                    <br><br>
                    Next on the list, we have Braden whose ideal job is System Engineer at Mine Sight Technologies.
                    Compared
                    to those mentioned above, there are some similarities since he will be dealing with both software
                    and
                    hardware development. However, the main difference is that he will be mainly focusing on finding
                    other
                    technological advancements such as new technology and equipments to be used in their industry.
                    Besides,
                    he will also be testing and developing these technologies to best implement them to the company's
                    system
                    to suit its needs.
                    <br><br>
                    Another member of our team is Tori who is interested in User Experience design. Her job despite
                    being
                    quite different from the others in our group, has a big impact on the overall quality of our
                    products
                    and how our clients communicate with them. She will be working with mostly software based and web
                    based
                    languages such as HTML, Java Script, etc.. Being someone working in the design aspect of the
                    products,
