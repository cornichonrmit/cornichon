I was enrolled in Melbourne Grammar School from the day i started schooling and graduated year 12 in 2018. My interest in IT started at a young age with the family computer, i would always be playing games, then once i got my own personal laptop i got more interested in the technical side and was introduced to a robotics subject that was available at school. After a year of robotics our school, a inter-school competition was held, and after that my interest in IT related concepts has only grown, moving from robotics to programming and game hacking.</p>

                        <p>The purpose of this segment is to look at the individual group members test results, such as the myers briggs test or other emotion / working ability tests. From comparing results we can compare group members and see who will be most effective in certain parts of the project. We can also use this comparison to make the group working experience as fluid as possible</p>
