            <h3><strong>IT Technologies</strong></h3>
            <p>For our IT Technologies, we researched the following 4 topics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Raspberry Pi’s, Makey Makeys, Arduinos and other Small Computing Devices</li>

                <h4 style="color:#355C7D">Raspberry Pi’s, Makey Makeys, Arduinos and other Small Computing Devices</h4>
                <p>
                    A Raspberry Pi “is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV,
                    and uses a standard keyboard and mouse.”
                    <br> A Makey Makey “is an invention kit for the 21stcentury. Turn everyday objects into touchpads
                    and combine them with the internet. It’s a simple Invention Kit for Beginners and Experts doing art,
                    engineering, and everything in between.”
                    <br>An Arduino “is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. Arduino consists
                    of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece
                    of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer, used to write
                    and upload computer code to the physical board”.
                    <br>These small computing devices and other mini PCs can be used for many things: as a mini desktop,
                    a tv set top box, a VPN or even use it to make a cup of tea! There are many tutorials online on
                    different types of projects that can be made with small computing devices.
                    <br>The future of mini computers and other small computing devices is bright, as the technology will
                    continue to improve. With the declining PC sales in recent years, the increasing popularity of the
                    mini PC could breathe new life back into the PC market. The introduction of the mini PC has combined
                    the portability of a laptop with the processing power of a tower PC, all at the small size of a deck
                    of cards.
                    <br>The partial customisation of the mini PC may not currently compete with the fully customisable
                    tower PC, but it wasn’t too long ago that mini computers weren’t able to be customised. So,
                    continuing the development of the mini computers, they should have the same opportunity to provide
                    the customisation that desktop computers currently possess.
                    <br>The best mini PC on the market is the Intel NUC (Next Unit of Computing). Intel has many mini
                    PCs that are at the top of the market. Intel have even created models of their mini PC that can be
                    used to play games. Many mini PCs can do the same tasks as regular PCs and performance has a similar
                    range to the traditional model, whether internet browsing or casual gaming.
                    <br> Mini PCs are also positive for the environment, as they don’t use as much energy to run as a
                    regular tower PC. They can take on a similar work load and are built in a more durable, robust
                    fashion, which can help extend the life span of the computer.
                </p>
                <ul> What are the main advantages of mini computers?
                    <li> Size, mini PCs save a huge amount of space and with the advancements in technology, can do a
                        similar job compared to a traditional PC.
                    </li>
                    <li> Power consumption, they were created to run on less power than a regular PC.
                    </li>
                    <li> Cost, the cost of a mini PC compared to a traditional PC is miniscule.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    What are the main disadvantages of mini computers?
                    <li> When you buy a mini PC, that is all you get. Other accessories like the keyboard, monitor and
                        mouse will be needed to be purchased separately.
                    </li>
                    <li> There are only certain parts that you can customise, unlike a tower PC which is fully
                        customisable.
                    </li>
                    <li> The RAM is closer to something you would see in a laptop, rather than in a desktop computer.
                        Laptop RAM is smaller and costs a fraction more, but the performance is similar.
                    </li>
                    <li> Gaming is possible; however, it is not recommended on a mini PC, if you are serious about
                        gaming. But, a more casual gamer should be able to use a mini PC with limited issues.
                    </li>
                    <li> If a “barebones” mini PC is bought no operating system is pre-installed. But there are some
                        “non-barebones” mini PCs that don’t come with a pre-installed operating system.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <br> The ability of being able to make hardware smaller has been the major factor of the creation of
                    the mini computer. As the technology improves, it is possible that computers will continue to
                    decrease in size, while not compromising on performance. There has been significant growth in the
                    market for mini pcs, not only due to their price, but also with the improvements of technology as
                    not much performance is being sacrificed by using a mini computer.
                    <br> With the continued development of the Internet of Things, where the number of devices connected
                    to the internet will be approximately 1.5 billion by 2022, mini PCs like the Raspberry Pi show that
                    we don’t need super computers to do simple, more routine IT tasks. Mini computers will be more
                    common as the technology continues to become smaller and more powerful.
                    <br> There has been nearly 18 million Raspberry Pi units sold. With the continued improvements of
                    the product, tower PCs could be made redundant and mini PCs like the Raspberry Pi could be favoured
                    for their price and size. Mini PCs are also a favourable option for businesses because of the
                    combination of the low cost of running them as well as the low price of the hardware.
                    <br> The Raspberry Pi is super versatile, being used in classrooms, libraries, hackspaces, research
                    labs and even in industry environments. A Raspberry Pi is an easy and inexpensive way for people to
                    learn about computers and computing projects. The range of possible projects makes the Raspberry Pi
                    perfect for beginners or experts in the computing field. The mini PC allows for the user to “tinker”
                    with the device and be able to continually explore the opportunities of the digital world.
                    <br> Raspberry Pi’s and other mini computing devices will be able to help education systems around
                    the world improve their computing programs. Students will be active learners and can learn without
                    restrictions, due to the open software and hardware platforms that are available with these devices.
                    However, just purchasing these devices won’t be enough. The curriculum would need to be updated,
                    teachers will need to be taught how to use them and schools would need to purchase complementary
                    equipment. Products like mini computing devices in schools have the potential to improve tech
                    literacy of the next generation, which is needed with the continued development of the Internet of
                    Things.
                    <br> The cost of these mini computers is an advantage that will help take computing studies around
                    the globe, giving everyone an equal chance at learning about the digital era. Students in India,
                    Cameroon, Nicaragua, Ghana and other counties are all learning about computing because of the
                    Raspberry Pi. Mini PCs like the Raspberry Pi are helping to grow the tech sector overseas and due to
                    the versatility, it can become a staple for tech start-ups.
                    <br> The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a “UK-based charity that works to put the power of computing and
                    digital making into the hands of people all over the world”. The Raspberry Pi Foundation has been
                    able to fund and create “RACHEL Pi”, an offline server that is run on a Raspberry Pi and has been
                    designed specifically for educating people in the developing world. This server isn’t just for
                    students, but other people that may have a device can also connect to RACHEL to learn and enjoy the
                    free resources provided. People can learn from Khan Academy or Wikipedia, or harness practical
                    skills like farming or cultivating mushrooms.
