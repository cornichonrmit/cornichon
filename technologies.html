            <h3><strong>IT Technologies</strong></h3>
            <p>For our IT Technologies, we researched the following 4 topics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Raspberry Pi’s, Makey Makeys, Arduinos and other Small Computing Devices</li>

                <h4 style="color:#355C7D">Raspberry Pi’s, Makey Makeys, Arduinos and other Small Computing Devices</h4>
                <p>
                    A Raspberry Pi “is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV,
                    and uses a standard keyboard and mouse.”
                    <br> A Makey Makey “is an invention kit for the 21stcentury. Turn everyday objects into touchpads
                    and combine them with the internet. It’s a simple Invention Kit for Beginners and Experts doing art,
                    engineering, and everything in between.”
                    <br>An Arduino “is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. Arduino consists
                    of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece
                    of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer, used to write
                    and upload computer code to the physical board”.
                    <br>These small computing devices and other mini PCs can be used for many things: as a mini desktop,
                    a tv set top box, a VPN or even use it to make a cup of tea! There are many tutorials online on
                    different types of projects that can be made with small computing devices.
                    <br>The future of mini computers and other small computing devices is bright, as the technology will
                    continue to improve. With the declining PC sales in recent years, the increasing popularity of the
                    mini PC could breathe new life back into the PC market. The introduction of the mini PC has combined
                    the portability of a laptop with the processing power of a tower PC, all at the small size of a deck
                    of cards.
                    <br>The partial customisation of the mini PC may not currently compete with the fully customisable
                    tower PC, but it wasn’t too long ago that mini computers weren’t able to be customised. So,
                    continuing the development of the mini computers, they should have the same opportunity to provide
                    the customisation that desktop computers currently possess.
                    <br>The best mini PC on the market is the Intel NUC (Next Unit of Computing). Intel has many mini
                    PCs that are at the top of the market. Intel have even created models of their mini PC that can be
                    used to play games. Many mini PCs can do the same tasks as regular PCs and performance has a similar
                    range to the traditional model, whether internet browsing or casual gaming.
                    <br> Mini PCs are also positive for the environment, as they don’t use as much energy to run as a
                    regular tower PC. They can take on a similar work load and are built in a more durable, robust
                    fashion, which can help extend the life span of the computer.
                </p>
                <ul> What are the main advantages of mini computers?
                    <li> Size, mini PCs save a huge amount of space and with the advancements in technology, can do a
                        similar job compared to a traditional PC.
                    </li>
                    <li> Power consumption, they were created to run on less power than a regular PC.
                    </li>
                    <li> Cost, the cost of a mini PC compared to a traditional PC is miniscule.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    What are the main disadvantages of mini computers?
                    <li> When you buy a mini PC, that is all you get. Other accessories like the keyboard, monitor and
                        mouse will be needed to be purchased separately.
                    </li>
                    <li> There are only certain parts that you can customise, unlike a tower PC which is fully
                        customisable.
                    </li>
                    <li> The RAM is closer to something you would see in a laptop, rather than in a desktop computer.
                        Laptop RAM is smaller and costs a fraction more, but the performance is similar.
                    </li>
                    <li> Gaming is possible; however, it is not recommended on a mini PC, if you are serious about
                        gaming. But, a more casual gamer should be able to use a mini PC with limited issues.
                    </li>
                    <li> If a “barebones” mini PC is bought no operating system is pre-installed. But there are some
                        “non-barebones” mini PCs that don’t come with a pre-installed operating system.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <br> The ability of being able to make hardware smaller has been the major factor of the creation of
                    the mini computer. As the technology improves, it is possible that computers will continue to
                    decrease in size, while not compromising on performance. There has been significant growth in the
                    market for mini pcs, not only due to their price, but also with the improvements of technology as
                    not much performance is being sacrificed by using a mini computer.
                    <br> With the continued development of the Internet of Things, where the number of devices connected
                    to the internet will be approximately 1.5 billion by 2022, mini PCs like the Raspberry Pi show that
                    we don’t need super computers to do simple, more routine IT tasks. Mini computers will be more
                    common as the technology continues to become smaller and more powerful.
                    <br> There has been nearly 18 million Raspberry Pi units sold. With the continued improvements of
                    the product, tower PCs could be made redundant and mini PCs like the Raspberry Pi could be favoured
                    for their price and size. Mini PCs are also a favourable option for businesses because of the
                    combination of the low cost of running them as well as the low price of the hardware.
                    <br> The Raspberry Pi is super versatile, being used in classrooms, libraries, hackspaces, research
                    labs and even in industry environments. A Raspberry Pi is an easy and inexpensive way for people to
                    learn about computers and computing projects. The range of possible projects makes the Raspberry Pi
                    perfect for beginners or experts in the computing field. The mini PC allows for the user to “tinker”
                    with the device and be able to continually explore the opportunities of the digital world.
                    <br> Raspberry Pi’s and other mini computing devices will be able to help education systems around
                    the world improve their computing programs. Students will be active learners and can learn without
                    restrictions, due to the open software and hardware platforms that are available with these devices.
                    However, just purchasing these devices won’t be enough. The curriculum would need to be updated,
                    teachers will need to be taught how to use them and schools would need to purchase complementary
                    equipment. Products like mini computing devices in schools have the potential to improve tech
                    literacy of the next generation, which is needed with the continued development of the Internet of
                    Things.
                    <br> The cost of these mini computers is an advantage that will help take computing studies around
                    the globe, giving everyone an equal chance at learning about the digital era. Students in India,
                    Cameroon, Nicaragua, Ghana and other counties are all learning about computing because of the
                    Raspberry Pi. Mini PCs like the Raspberry Pi are helping to grow the tech sector overseas and due to
                    the versatility, it can become a staple for tech start-ups.
                    <br> The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a “UK-based charity that works to put the power of computing and
                    digital making into the hands of people all over the world”. The Raspberry Pi Foundation has been
                    able to fund and create “RACHEL Pi”, an offline server that is run on a Raspberry Pi and has been
                    designed specifically for educating people in the developing world. This server isn’t just for
                    students, but other people that may have a device can also connect to RACHEL to learn and enjoy the
                    free resources provided. People can learn from Khan Academy or Wikipedia, or harness practical
                    skills like farming or cultivating mushrooms.

                <h4 style="color:#355C7D">Cyber Security</h4>
                <p>
                    Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks and programs from digital attacks.
                    Everyone benefits from strong cybersecurity, at an individual level and both business and
                    governmental levels. An individual could have their identity stolen or lose personal information and
                    data like family photos or could be blackmailed. Businesses and governments need to protect their
                    large amount of private information.
                    <br>There are four main technologies that are used in cybersecurity. Hardware authentication,
                    user-behaviour analytics, data loss prevention and deep and machine learning.
                    <br>“Hardware authentication is an approach to user authentication that relies on a dedicated
                    physical device (such as a token) held by an authorised user, in addition to a basic password, to
                    grant access to computer resources.”
                    <br>A more secure authentication process is needed than a username and password. As even long and
                    complicated passwords can be hacked. Long and harder to hack passwords are hard to remember.
                    <br>Multifactor authentication is being used by Intel, with many different ways of logging in are
                    being used in combination with each other to provide more security. Having many steps to log in may
                    be a little extra hassle for a lot of extra security. The combination of the hardware authentication
                    and password creates a two-factor authentication (2FA) system. There is no perfectly secure
                    authentication system. However, two-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security,
                    making the process harder to hack into.
                    <br>“User-behaviour analytics (UBA) is a set of algorithms that analyse log activity to spot
                    abnormal behaviour, such as repeated login attempts from a single IP address or large file
                    downloads.” Or put simply, “UBA is the tracking, collecting and assessing of user data and
                    activities using monitoring systems”.
                    <br>It determines a baseline that all activity is compared to – which can help detect deviations
                    from the normal routine of the user. For UBA to work, it relies on packet detection, signature
                    detection, log analysis, advanced analytics and artificial intelligence. UBA takes some time to
                    implement, as there needs to be a big enough dataset to understand the user’s habits online, but it
                    also has to be nuanced enough to understand that there isn’t a breach in security if the user is not
                    following their specific habits. This balance is difficult because you don’t want to be too lenient
                    nor too strict.
                    <br>Data loss prevention (DLP), monitors all data when it is in transit, at rest and in use.
                    <br>Data in transit protection – is data in a network (internal or external) that is going to an end
                    destination. DLP tools encrypt the data and use an encrypted transport system like a VPN or SSL to
                    help deliver the data.
                    <br>Data in use protection – this is data that is used by an application or product. DLP will
                    encrypt the sensitive data and not allow the transmission of the data to any unauthorised storage
                    systems.
                    <br>Data at rest protection – this is data that is stored in an archive. DLP tools make sure that
                    the whole database is encrypted, but it can be encrypted at many levels: field, table, or the whole
                    database.
                    <br>DLP looks for attempts from an unauthorised figure or figures that is trying to access the data,
                    to make sure that they cannot get hold of it.
                    <br>Deep Learning is “a set of techniques for implementing machine learning that recognize patterns
                    of patterns - like image recognition. The systems identify primarily object edges, a structure, an
                    object type, and then an object itself.”
                    <br>Machine Learning is “an approach to AI that uses a system that is capable of learning from
                    experience… ML is a system that can recognize patterns by using examples rather than by programming
                    them.”
                    <br>Current trends: Unsupervised Learning. This is a “data driven” approach. It is not as precise as
                    supervised approaches, but it uses the properties of the unlabelled data it is analysing to find
                    abnormalities. This is a powerful approach because it is difficult to categorise data, especially if
                    it is not labelled.
                    <br>Semi-supervised learning. This technique tries to combine benefits from both supervised and
                    unsupervised approaches, when there are some labelled data.
                    <br>Future trends: Reinforcement learning. An “environment driven” approach that can be used when
                    the behaviour needs to react to a changing environment. It’s like a kid who is learning environment
                    by trial and error.
                    <br>Active learning. It’s currently a subclass of reinforcement learning that will eventually grow
                    into its own class. Active learning is like a teacher who can correct both errors and behaviour as
                    well as dealing with environmental changes effectively.
                    <br>The difficulty of using Machine Learning and Deep Learning is that there needs to be
                    anticipation of how information is going to be stolen. The properties of how the data is going to be
                    taken needs to be decided and then needs to be engineered for the deep learning or machine learning
                    system.
                    <br>Machine Learning and Deep Learning use the following processes to help protect users from a
                    cyber-attack.
                    <br>Prediction: it predicts future values based on the information of previous known values.
                    <br>Classification: separating values into specific categories.
                    <br>Clustering: a similar action to classification, but the specific categories are unknown, so
                    values with similar attributes are grouped together.
                    <br>Recommendation: using information from previous values to recommend an action for a future
                    value.
                    <br>Generalisation: searching for common and important attributes in many values.
                    <br>Generative models: creating something new based on the information distribution of previous
                    values.
                    <br>Hardware authentication will be crucial with the continued development of the Internet of
                    Things, due to all of the devices that will be eventually connected to the internet. All of these
                    devices could be compromised by a hacker. Intel has created a processor that has a dedicated section
                    to the process of authentication, this will potentially become commonplace in the future, as people
                    will have more devices connected and more of their personal information stored on the internet.
                    <br>Cybersecurity is constantly evolving, alongside the production of new technologies, so with
                    this, there will always be jobs to invent new ways to protect both networks and people from
                    cybercrime. It will also continue to improve due to the ever-changing nature of cybercrime. There is
                    no such thing as a computer or system that is completely secure. Which is why cybersecurity is
                    crucial, especially with the interconnected nature of devices and the development of the Internet of
                    Things. There will have to be a strong foundation of security to keep users and their information
                    private, because the prevention of cyberattacks is more important than stopping them while they are
                    happening.
                    <br>Everyone that uses the internet are constantly affected by the threat of cybercrime. The
                    introduction of stronger cybersecurity with these technologies will help everyone to be protected
                    online.
                    <br>According to Cybersecurity Ventures, there will be 3.5 million cybersecurity jobs by 2021.
                    Australia has a severe lack of cybersecurity professionals. A survey from Intel Security shows that
                    88 per cent of Australian information technology professionals believe that there is indeed a
                    shortage in the cybersecurity field. Fifty-three percent of professionals that responded believe
                    that the ‘talent shortage in cybersecurity is somewhat or far worse than in other IT professions’.
                    <br>There is a personal impact of cybercrime. Anyone that has a device that connects to the internet
                    can be a victim of a cyberattack. Cybercriminals will be able to find vulnerabilities in devices if
                    people aren’t careful and secure with their online actions. People who are victims of cybercrime can
                    not only have their money stolen, but also their personal information and reputation. All people
                    have to be careful when using the internet, even if they think they “don’t have much to offer
                    hackers”. Forty per cent of millennials have reported that they have experiences a cybercrime in the
                    past year.

                <h4 style="color:#355C7D">Autonomous Vehicles</h4>
                <p>
                    An Autonomous Vehicle is a type of transport which is able to operate independently without human
                    input. These systems of transport are currently operating in trains, aircraft and are under
                    development for cars.<br>
                    The application of the system within trains has been successfully demonstrated over the decades,
                    resulting in maximum efficiency of resources and reliability of operations. Trains with ‘Automatic
                    Train Operation (ATO)’ are able to operate basic functions independently of the driver’s input. The
                    functions consist of accelerating and decelerating while adhering to signals sent from the control
                    center. The human presence is required to act as a safeguard in case of system failure, so that
                    there is always a person who is able to operate the train. There are many large cities which operate
                    fully Autonomous Trains such as Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong, London and many more. The
                    implementation of the autonomous system has significantly reduced basic human errors in railway
                    industries.<br>
                    In the aviation industry, the autonomous system serves as an assistant to the pilots. The system in
                    aviation is more commonly known as the Autopilot, which has the capability of flying the aircraft
                    shortly after take-off, cruise and landing at the destination. The autopilot handles flight
                    components such as airspeed, heading, vertical speed, altitude, engine parameters and countless
                    other systems onboard the aircraft. However, like laptop computers they require constant monitoring
                    and inputs to perform tasks. The sophistication level of the computers does not have authority in
                    situations such as course deviations due to weather obstacles or system failures. The pilot must
                    always manage the autopilot, in which it will endeavour to comply with the instructed commands.
                    Above everything else, the Pilot always has full authority over the computers and is able to
                    override at any moment.<br>
                    On the ground, automobile companies have been developing and deploying vehicles which have automatic
                    cruise control autopilot which has the ability to travel in a set lane and make switches without any
                    human inputs. The technology is limited to the open highways and is currently unable to operate on
                    heavy-traffic roads. The system is designed to relieve driver stress and fatigue on long journeys on
                    the road, so that when they are approaching difficult and challenging surrounding, they are more
                    alert and able to manipulate the vehicle safely to their destination.<br>
                    The current state of the technology­­ is constantly under development as the field is relatively new
                    and programmers and engineers are still grappling to make these vehicles safer and more reliable.
                    The market is also adjusting to the introduction of the vehicles, in which it is projected to take
                    some time as customers shift their perspective of the technology.<br>
                    In the upcoming years to come, the technology which governs automation in vehicles will be
                    significantly improved. Research and Development will always attempt to improve mistakes and
                    boundaries imposed on today’s technology, in the sense that autonomous cars will become predominant
                    in everyday life, efficiency and reduce impact on the environment.<br>
                    According to a recent article interviewing Elon Musk, the use of Lidar technology is actually not
                    required for a car to sense its surrounding. Instead, a basic camera can serve as a replacement to
                    the expensive Lidar as the car would be also able to perform the same task.<br>
                    In addition to the physical features of the vehicles, the software is an essential part of the loop
                    which has the responsibility of maintaining safety of passengers and surroundings. The next
                    generation of vehicles would have enhanced software and intelligence which will proceed current
                    generations.<br>
                    The potential impact of the development will result in a larger amount of Autonomous Vehicle
                    operating with other cars on the road. Constant testing of the technology allows for better
                    understanding and improvements to be made for the technology to become mature for commercial
                    release. The technology intends to improve the quality of life, but the process will most likely
                    create redundancies of occupation from the workforce. The competition offered by the technology is
                    efficiency and effectiveness of services, in which positions such as delivery and personal transport
                    drivers. The traditional role of a human driver at the controls will be redefined with a computer at
                    the helm, however this will not occur for some time because the technology is currently still in its
                    infancy stage.<br>
                    Although the role of the driver may be likely to be declared as redundant in the future, there also
                    open new opportunities to work within the field. The vehicles require constant maintenance to
                    operate, therefore the need for programmers and mechanics is larger because the demand will be
                    higher. The onboard navigation computer will likely be the feature that require the most frequent
                    updates for better reliability and quality of the vehicle’s travel. Programmers will also be on high
                    demand to tweak performance and efficiency of operations of the vehicles. The end of an era begins
                    for some occupations, though new opportunities will be able to flourish. Automation does not
                    necessarily mean ‘redundancy’; as long as people are willing to adapt to the environment opportunity
                    will exist.<br>
                    Autonomous Vehicles is more than likely to cause a huge impact in my daily life routine. The result
                    is perceived to be positive as the technology would become safer and most efficient over time in
                    full deployment.<br>
                    A vision of the technology in my life is that when travelling from home to a destination, the
                    autonomous car would notify my phone within 5 minutes of its arrival. The circumstance is beneficial
                    for conducting time-critical activities as the computer’s estimation gives an indication of when to
                    expect the vehicle to arrive. This means that the computer can give valuable information which could
                    be shared with friends in planning for social activities or meetings & interviews with professional
                    environment.<br>
                    As the car is boarded, its safety system would first validate and determine if the passenger is
                    secure and ready for departure. It would prompt for securing seatbelts and loose items for storage.
                    The vehicle has no human driver which means this free up space for more capacity, in which is seen
                    is possible to free up congestion on the road as for the extra capacity of the vehicle means that
                    there is less need for excessive cars on the road. Once the car begins to depart, the navigation
                    system will cross check to find the fastest and most efficient route to get to from home to my
                    destination. The estimated journey time and fare is displayed which is reasonable for the level of
                    service and punctuality provided by the vehicle.<br>
                    Arriving at the destination, the car would let its passengers disembark and making sure no items are
                    left behind in the cabin, before finally departing to pick up other passengers. The model displayed
                    in this scenario is a taxi-style transport which roams around locations picking up passengers and
                    delivering them safely to their destinations. The system is likely to be based of ridesharing
                    system, however the market for personal vehicles coexist on the road together.<br>

                <p>
                    A robot by definition is an automated machine which is able to perform tasks and replicate functions
                    automatically. The general term for the machine is that its job is to assist in executing automated
                    functions such as in manufacturing, complex intelligence and much more. There are many applications
                    of robots in the world that takes different forms individually.<br>
                    In the manufacturing industry, robots perform tasks which humans could not replicate repetitively
                    because of the conditions and the circumstances required for the result. A car-manufacturing
                    facility would employ robots to complete welding frames and secondary quality checking of products.
                    Humans are simply too fallible to conduct tasks like this, in which it makes perfect sense to give
                    robot this task as they are far more productive and improve cost and time efficiency of the
                    production line. Most of the mass-produced cars on the road today including autonomous vehicles have
                    been physically assembled by robots for most of the critical parts and joints, however some tasks
                    are only able to be conducted by human operators.<br>
                    For robots operating in the complex intelligence field, it does not necessarily mean that they are a
                    part of an Intelligence organization but instead they are more in terms of interacting with people,
                    in which they are able to communicate in natural-language. The natural language is basically common
                    colloquial language, in which the syntax for the robot to understand is quite flexible in contrast
                    to manufacturing counterparts. A great example of this instance is Honda’s ASIMO, who is able to
                    carry a conversation naturally with humans. The market for robots with complex intelligence is still
                    growing, but similar to manufacturing it is seen to have some growth in the not too distant future.
                    <br>
                    The advancement of robotics technology in today’s era is accelerating at a faster pace, with
                    automated machines having the capability from basic repetitive functions to complex interaction with
                    human beings. Another example of a robot integrating both the simple and complex interaction is
                    Changi Airport’s cleaning robot, who does the basic function of cleaning the floor of the terminal
                    and also able to respond to human obstructions in a polite manner. The robot assists the airport in
                    maintaining a clean environment with efficiency in time and labour; the robotic cleaner can operate
                    with accuracy and report if any arising issues are encountered which may require human intervention.
                    <br>
                    The next three years of robotics development will take the machine to expand into more fields and
                    purposes. The robots are not restricted to their forms, however interoperability between the
                    software systems and their hardware are able to make the flow of development more streamlined.
                    The use of unmanned-aerial vehicles incorporates advanced software system such as that of military
                    drones and more recently commercial civilian units. The military have been using machines such as
                    the MQ-9 Reaper drone for reconnaissance and combat operations, in the case that there is no manned
                    pilot onboard the aircraft. The drone is considered to be a special type of robotics as its software
                    system is advanced in navigation system and remote flight control input, which it is not limited to
                    being on the ground but able to fly in the air.<br>
                    Google’s Wing Delivery Drone has its approval from the Federal Aviation Administration, in which its
                    design is permitted to carry cargo from depot and deliver to the customer. The design of the drone
                    allows the robot to manoeuvre effectively with the ability to access difficult locations and terrain
                    in which it would have been challenging for a human to do. The drone’s technology will prompt other
                    robotics companies and initiatives to develop their own version, in which would ignite the market
                    for competition.<br>
                    The likelihood of impact on current jobs and occupations would be tremendous if humans were to
                    become immediately redundant by robotics labour. It would be projected that the unemployment rate
                    would proceed in unprecedented levels, but fortunately the reality is that robots will not be fully
                    taking over human jobs any time soon. Although some occupations are projected to be overtaken by the
                    robots, others are simply irreplaceable in terms of the skills and requirements which can only be
                    able to be done by humans. The first stage of robotics job would most likely target the lower levels
                    of occupation, in which people working in this sector would have a higher risk of having their jobs
                    becoming redundant. Sectors such as cleaning and general sanitation will become deeply impacted, as
                    represented by Changi Airport’s automated cleaning robot.<br>
                    However, robots taking over certain jobs does not necessarily mean the end of opportunities, but
                    instead new occupations will appear to take care and maintain the robots for operational conditions.
                    This type of change is not likely to occur in a short period of time, as it will take numerous
                    testing and requirement to pass regulation bills before full deployment of the technology. The
                    timeframe between the era and the present day give people the opportunity to prepare and adapt to
                    the inevitable change.<br>
                    In the meantime, developers are able to improve current technology and methods to make for a better
                    way of improving the reliability and practically of the machines. The major issue faced by engineers
                    today is battery life, in which the machines are ultimately dependent to operate their function.
                    Manufacturing robots do not concern as much of power source as their field of operation is mainly
                    inside the manufacturing facility, where the power supply is virtually stable to support their
                    functions. In terms of development, batteries are projected to become more compact in size with the
                    provision of greater capacity of the standards of today.<br>
                    Robotics would have a profound impact on myself and surrounding because of its unique nature to
                    coexist in society. A scenario that I am able to imagine for robots in the world in the coming
                    decades is similar to the way they are portrayed in films such as Star Wars, where they are able to
                    independently compute for themselves while also following their set of instructions and execute them
                    effectively with reliability. An appropriate example is a robot assistant where they are able to
                    help in carrying loads of items which would have been difficult to do individually.<br>
                    The assistant essentially performs the same duties similar to a personal butler with cooking food,
                    cleaning the house and hospitality. Friends and families are able to enjoy life more comfortably as
                    they would be able to minimize their concerns on basic mundane tasks. The design of robots
                    physically and philosophically in society gradually changes to fulfil tasks, with an appearance like
                    a human being or as the purpose requires. Particularly in age-care facilities, robots are able to
                    provide presence beside senior citizens for extended periods of time than a human would be able to
                    do on duty. Age-care robots are able to perform more efficiently in time critical tasks, such as
                    defibrillator and medical aid until the paramedics and carer have arrived.<br>
                    There are plenty of opportunities for the robots in the world, to share existence and help humans
                    with challenging tasks. The possibilities of robotics in the future are virtually endless, only
                    limited by the imagination and creativity of the people who design and create the machines.
