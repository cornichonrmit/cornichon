                <h4 style="color:#355C7D">Question 1:</h4>
                <p><strong>Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</strong><br>
                    I work for Telstra, Australia’s largest telecommunications company. I was employed as a software
                    engineer 13 years ago, and today, I lead a delivery team of 9 developers/testers. My current team is
                    responsible for the design, build and support of the API layer that sits behind the AFL front end
                    web and mobile applications.
                </p>
                <h4 style="color:#355C7D">Question 2:</h4>
                <p><strong>Please tell us about the industry you work in.</strong><br>
                    The primary purpose of telecommunications industry has historically been to connect people. The way
                    this achieved has (and will continue to) changed over time. When I joined Telstra, industry
                    standards were GSM, CDMA, ADSL. The software we developed existed to support Telstra’s Broadband and
                    Mobile customers. Things like data usage widgets, 3G connection wizards etc.
                    <br>
                    Whilst our core business is still to connect people, the technologies today are 4GX/5G, fibre-optic
                    (NBN) and the demands for bandwidth and speed are increasing exponentially year on year. With major
                    industry changes in Australia like the NBN, Telstra’s dominance and position in the market is
                    changing. This has also changed the nature of the software we develop.
                </p>
                <h4 style="color:#355C7D">Question 3:</h4>
                <p><strong>What other kinds of work do you have to do?</strong><br>
                    Software development is one part of the job. We also participate in the discovery and design of new
                    ideas, we have a strong focus on quality assurance (unit, functional, stress and volume testing).
                    Our modern delivery teams are responsible for the software from idea – all the way to support in
                    production. For AFL, which is a highly visible and timely sport, we run a support roster for all
                    live games, ensuring there will always be someone to react if anything were to go wrong.
                    <br>
                    As a leader, I am also required to mentor the junior team members, reviewing their work and
                    providing input into their development plans. I also have a development plan, and I work with my
                    management to decide how I can grow my own skills and career opportunities.
                </p>
                <h4 style="color:#355C7D">Question 4:</h4>
                <p><strong></strong><br>
                    In an enterprise the size of Telstra (currently about 30,000 employees globally), people will
                    typically interact with colleagues spread across the globe and in different departments/business
                    units. My delivery team is split across Tasmania, Melbourne, Sydney and Bangalore (India).
                    <br>
                    Most of my daily communication is within my delivery team, but we also interface with:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        AFL Media and Telstra Product Management. These are our clients. They shape the roadmap and
                        direction of the products we offer to customers. Marketing, product research and pricing also
                        done by these teams.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Core groups like Telstra Security. They provide guidance on modern security standards for
                        delivery teams to comply with.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Human Resources and other support channels exist for employees as required.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We also interact with line management. As a leader, I have to communicate upwards and sideways
                        to different teams.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Other delivery teams. Telstra encourages us to share knowledge within teams both informally and
                        via dedicated Community of Practice sessions.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4 style="color:#355C7D">Question 5:</h4>
                <p><strong>Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</strong><br>
                    Within the company, we collaborate in a number of different ways. Historically, email has been the
                    most prolific form of communication, however there is a strong push to move to more collaborative
                    channels, due to the productivity challenges of having a constant stream of emails. Such channels
                    include: Video conference, instant messaging, Yammer (our internal social media channel), and Slack,
                    which is fast becoming the preferred way to collaborate.
                    <br>
                    Within the delivery team, we run an agile (Scrum) model. We deliver new features to the business in
                    2 week sprints and we synchronise in cadence with other delivery teams like AFL Media and Pulse
                    Live, who build the front-end applications for AFL. This type of work model comes with certain
                    rituals like daily stand-ups for progress checks, showcases of new work and retrospectives for
                    iterative improvement.
                </p>
                <h4 style="color:#355C7D">Question 6:</h4>
                <p><strong>What about your interactions with clients or investors?</strong><br>
                    As a non-customer-facing team, our client interaction is primarily with the product management
                    sector of the company. We’re shifting to a more integrated approach whereby we integrate these roles
                    into delivery teams, rather than interface to another team. You can think of the product management
                    as both a client and an investor. Historically, large companies like Telstra have separated off
                    Product and Delivery. Product pitches the ideas, acquires funding based on a business case and
                    engages Delivery to design and build. Having an organisational separation like this comes with
                    communication challenges and barriers.
                    <br>
                    Whilst it is challenging to change this model, Telstra is trying to break down the walls between
                    these groups and achieve an integrated, agile work model across the company.
                </p>
                <h4 style="color:#355C7D">Question 7:</h4>
                <p><strong>What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</strong><br>
                    This really depends which hat I’m wearing, and it changes rapidly. One week or month I might be
                    heavily focussed on delivery. I’ll be cutting code, writing tests and working with the stakeholders
                    to ensure we’re building the right thing and shipping it on time. Other times, I am heavily focussed
                    on discovery/design of a new platform or concept. Sometimes, I’ll spend a large portion of my day
                    mentoring junior team members, reviewing their work and helping them bolster their capabilities.
                    <br>
                    A typical developer in my team might spend 40-50% of their time writing tests, 30-40% of their time
                    writing the functionality and the rest of their day researching, self-learning and admin/team
                    rituals.
                </p>
                <h4 style="color:#355C7D">Question 8:</h4>
                <p><strong>Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</strong><br>
                    When I started at Telstra, the technical part of my job was incredibly challenging. I wasn’t a
                    strong developer and I was very fortunate to be placed with one of the company’s best. I was
                    expected to learn on the fly and pick up a lot of concepts that are now being taught at University
                    (Junit, mocking, Maven, Spring etc.). It probably took me 12 months before something clicked and I
                    started to find most new problems just permutations of old ones, making them easier to work through.
                    <br>
                    Today, the challenges in my role are more people and processes. Telstra is heavily involved in
                    organisational change, in order to reduce cost. We’re offshoring a lot of software development to
                    India and this is probably the biggest challenge in my current role. I’ve been involved in the
                    hiring (and unfortunately letting go) of team members in our various Indian delivery centres. By far
                    the most difficult aspect is trying to achieve cost efficient delivery without sacrificing quality
                    or time to market, whilst operating within the parameters given to us by Telstra’s executive
                    management.
                </p>
                <h4 style="color:#355C7D">Question 9:</h4>
                <p><strong>Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT
                    industry?</strong><br>
                    This is the example I use for new members in our delivery team, to explain our position in the
                    organisation and why what we do is important.
                    <br>
                    Telstra’s main game is to grow their customer base and retain as many existing customers as
                    possible. Think of this as all the people who have a monthly bill with Telstra. This might be a
                    mobile service, an ADSL/Cable Broadband fixed line service, an NBN connection. These carriage
                    services sit on top of either Telstra’s mobile network or NBN’s fibre network. With more competition
                    from other Telcos and the introduction of the NBN, Telstra’s margins are decreasing and focus is
                    stronger than ever on retaining and growing this customer base.
                    <br>
                    The AFL mobile rights and associated iOS, Android and web applications built by Telstra is a great
                    example of a service offered to customers by Telstra that differentiates us from other carriers.
                    Every Telstra mobile customer can have free access to view live AFL games on their mobile and there
                    are no data charges counting towards their monthly quotas. With over 2.5 million customers taking
                    this up, this offering is one small part of a strategic plan by Telstra that contributes towards the
                    real end goal, which is to retain customers. The role my team plays in this is critical to the
                    success of the AFL platform, which puts us at the centre of a meaningful product that has a real
                    impact to millions of customers and Telstra’s overall strategy.
