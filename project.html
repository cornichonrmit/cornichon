                <h3><strong>Project</strong></h3>
                <p>From each group members project we chose one that fit our criteria and worked for everyone. Here is an overview of what we aim to do and what obstacles we will have to overcome.</p>
                <div class="jumbotron">
                        <h4 style="color:#355C7D">Aim / Prospect</h4>
                        <p>As a group, looking at each individual ideas within the group, we chose to do the automatic plant watering system that would run via a raspberry pi 3. 
                            In 2015, almost half of Australians aged 18 years and over said that they consumed two or more serves of fruit / veg per day. 
                            When looking at the cost of the average fruit and veg, this can get really costly for the average consumer. 
                            This is why we think it is important for people to grow some of their own fruits and veg. And this doesn't have to be on a major scale of a backyard garden, 
                            we envision this as a portable section that can be moved and easily tended to in the modern kitchen.</p>

                            <p>The product itself will consist of a section for the selected plant to be placed inside, which will have the electronic housing connected. 
                            The design for this encasing and pot will have to be looked into heavily as aesthetic requirements and other considerations will have to be met. 
                            The automated watering will be controlled by a raspberry pi 3 (All components listed below), which will be connected to a water moisture sensor 
                            and a relay which will activate a pump inside a water reservoir, which will be accessible by the user and will have to be refilled at certain intervals.</p>

                            <h4 style="color:#355C7D">Materials / Components needed.</h4>
                            <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                                    <li><a href="https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/273310251939">Small Water Pump</a></li>
                                    <li><a href="https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/223212920415">8 Channel Relay Module</a></li>
                                    <li><a href="https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/132567970379">Hydroponic Light (Optional)</a></li>

                                    <li>Packet of GPIO Wires</li>
                                  </ul> 

                            <h4 style="color:#355C7D">Possible obstacles / considerations</h4>
                            <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                                <li>Because it will be inside, the product will have to include some sort of hydroponic light source so that the plant can still grow without sunlight. Some plants do not need light in this setting but still a major consideration.</li>
                                <li>Encasing electronics in a compact and aesthetically pleasing package. Because the product is meant for the modern kitchen, we need to give our consumers a wide variety of design choices to match their specific setting / aesthetic, this is important as we donâ€™t want our product to be intrusive, but an addition to the cooking space.</li>
                                <li>Water refills and user interaction. As the water compartment will have to be filled up every so often, the product will need to notify when it needs to be refilled.</li>
